- when we have 10s and 100s of functions <br>  and they all share a common variable.<br>  its better if those functions dont mutate the given variable
ex. set and tuples are immuutable


functions ~

### 1. Impure functions![[Impure functions]]
### 2. Pure Function ![[Pure function]]
In functional Programming we Swear by Pure functions and try not use Impure functions. but we need to use I/O and other impure action.

For functional Programming we try to keep the impure part to minimum and separated
