Making data immutable
- when we have 10's and 100's of functions <br>  and they all share a common variable.<br>  its better if those functions don't mutate the given variable

For functional Programming we try to keep the impure part to minimum and separated

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism


Inheritance is strictly OOP. concept
