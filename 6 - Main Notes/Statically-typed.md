Variables are known at Compile time.
We have to specify the Type of Variable when at Declaration or Assignment.
Once you declare a variable as a type you can not assign value of different type.
We can change Variable Type through [[Type Conversion]] 
ex.
	int a = 5
	float b = 6.5
	
	c = a +b
		:Will Return an error

**Example**
- C
- C++
- [[Golang]]
- Rust
